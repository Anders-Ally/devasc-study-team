Working together to pass the DEVASC exam
I learned that Github can be a little confusing to navigate but in the terminal view, it was simple to understand. 
I struggled with the uploading of a document part but that was because I didn't read the document properly (so as always a note to myself is to read the directions carefully and twice). 
I had never worked with git before but it was quite nice and simple. The commands meant what they said which was nice and it made it simple to remember. 
After a while, I got the hang of the commands and didn't need to look at their guide.
